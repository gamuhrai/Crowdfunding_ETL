Crowdfunding ETL Mini Project

Welcome to the Crowdfunding ETL Mini Project! This project showcases my expertise in building robust ETL pipelines using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. Together with my partner, we have diligently executed this project to extract, transform, and load data from Excel files into a PostgreSQL database, demonstrating our proficiency in data handling and database management.

Project Overview
Project Scope:

ETL Pipeline Implementation: We meticulously extracted data from crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx, transformed it into structured formats using Pandas, and efficiently loaded it into PostgreSQL.
Collaborative Approach: Throughout the project, effective communication and task division ensured seamless integration of our work, reflecting our ability to collaborate on complex projects.
Project Achievements:

Category and Subcategory DataFrames:

Extracted and transformed data from crowdfunding.xlsx to create category.csv and subcategory.csv, showcasing our skills in data parsing and manipulation.
Campaign DataFrame:

Developed a comprehensive campaign.csv with refined data columns from crowdfunding.xlsx, highlighting our proficiency in data structuring and conversion.
Contacts DataFrame:

Employed advanced techniques (Python dictionary methods or regular expressions) to extract and transform contacts.xlsx into contacts.csv, underscoring our versatility in data extraction methodologies.
Crowdfunding Database:

Designed an ERD using QuickDBD, which informed the creation of a meticulous crowdfunding_db_schema.sql with defined table schemas, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.
Implemented a PostgreSQL database (crowdfunding_db) and successfully imported CSV data while ensuring data integrity through rigorous validation.
Project Implementation
Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Programming Languages: Proficient in Python for data manipulation and transformation tasks.
Data Handling: Expertise in Pandas for data processing and cleansing operations.
Database Management: Competent in PostgreSQL for creating schemas, tables, and importing data.
Collaborative Excellence:

Communication: Maintained regular communication with my partners to synchronize efforts and ensure project milestones were met on schedule.
Problem-Solving: Applied critical thinking and analytical skills to overcome challenges and optimize data workflows effectively.
Conclusion
Through the Crowdfunding ETL Mini Project, I have demonstrated my ability to conceptualize, execute, and deliver a complex data engineering project. This experience underscores my proficiency in ETL processes, database management, and collaborative teamwork. I am eager to leverage these skills in a role where I can contribute to impactful projects and drive organizational success through data-driven insights.
